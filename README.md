# Openclassroom-Downloader
Downloads videos from Stanford's openclassroom, based off of Dimitrov's answer at http://askubuntu.com/questions/69159/how-to-download-stanford-open-classroom-videos.
Parallelized to download 10 at a time, and also asks for a directory to store the videos
as well as the course page url to avoid editing the source.
